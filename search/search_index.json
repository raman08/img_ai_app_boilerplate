Storing the Images\ud83d\udce4 and User Feedback Online Setting up Firebase Login in to Firebase , using your Gmail ID . Click on the Get Started button which will, take you to your console. Creating a project Click on Add project . Once you do so, a 3 Step process will start. Enter the name of your project. ( Pro tip: Keep the same name as the name of your App. It would make it easier to identify.) The next step is pretty self explanatory and you may/may not choose to enable google analytics. If you choose to enable google analytics, then you will have to select or create a Google Analytics account . If you choose not to, then a Create project button will appear instead of Continue. Once you click on Create project , you will land on Firebase Console. Setting up Storage Once you land on the Firebase Console, click on the Create Web App icon. Give the name of your web app and unless required, do not select the Hosting option and click next . Copy the code which appears and store in a config.txt file for later use. Click on Continue to Console . Once on Console, click on the Storage Option on the left panel and then click on Get Started . Click Next and then select a server closest to your location. Once the Storage is initiated, click on the Rules tab and change: allow read, write: if request.auth != null; to allow read, write; in the code snippet which appears on the screen. Note: This is only for testing purposes and in real life scenarios refrain from doing this. This change basically allows us the upload and download the images without authenticating every time. With this you have set up the Storage successfully . You can manage your app's cloud server from here. Setting up Realtime Database Click on the Realtime Database Option on the left panel. Once on the page, click on Create Database button. When you click the button, there will be a prompt to set the Security rules. It is recommended to start in locked mode so as to ensure security of the data. With this you have set up the Database successfully . Now whenever a user writes a feedback, you can check it here in this database. Since this database stores data in terms of JSON files, you can also export the JSON file and use it in whichever way you like. Linking Firebase in the App Since everything is set up in the Firebase Console, the only thing left to do is to link the services to your app. You can do it this way: Open firebase_bro.py Remember the config.txt file which we created earlier?
